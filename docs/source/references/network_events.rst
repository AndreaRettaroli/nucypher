Network Events
==============

When there is an interaction with NuCypher smart contracts, various on-chain events are emitted. These events are
defined in the :doc:`Contracts API </contracts_api/index>`, and they are queryable via the ``nucypher status events``
CLI command, and allows for any NuCypher Network event to be queried.


Querying Events
---------------

Since the number of events returned may be large, by default the query is limited to events within block numbers for the
current period. However, this is configurable using the ``--from-block`` option.

.. important::

    Depending on the Ethereum provider being used, the number of results a query is allowed to return may be limited.
    For example, on Infura this limit is currently 10,000.


For a full list of CLI options, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --help


For example, to view the staking rewards received by all Stakers in the current period, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name StakingEscrow --event-name Minted

The value ``1234567890123456789012`` is in NuNits and equates to approximately 1234.57 NU (1 NU = 10\ :sup:`18` NuNits).


To view the staking rewards received by all Stakers from block number ``11916685`` to ``11916688``, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name StakingEscrow --event-name Minted --from-block 11916685 --to-block 11916688

Event Filters
-------------

To aid with query limits and more specific queries, events can be filtered using the ``--event-filter``
option. Multiple ``--event-filter`` options can be defined, but note that only properties classified
as ``indexed`` in the event's solidity definition can be used as a filter.

For example, to view all of the commitments ever made by the Worker associated with a specific Staker run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name StakingEscrow --event-name CommitmentMade --event-filter staker=<STAKING_ADDRESS> --from-block 0

    Reading Latest Chaindata...
    Retrieving events from block 0 to latest

    --------- StakingEscrow Events ---------

    CommitmentMade:
      - (EventRecord) staker: <STAKER_ADDRESS>, period: 2650, value: 1234567890123456789012, block_number: 11057641
      - (EventRecord) staker: <STAKER_ADDRESS>, period: 2650, value: 1234567890123456789012, block_number: 11063640
      - (EventRecord) staker: <STAKER_ADDRESS>, period: 2650, value: 1234567890123456789012, block_number: 11070103
      - (EventRecord) staker: <STAKER_ADDRESS>, period: 2650, value: 1234567890123456789012, block_number: 11076964
      ...

To view the commitment made by the Worker associated with a specific Staker in period 18552, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name StakingEscrow --event-name CommitmentMade --event-filter staker=<STAKING_ADDRESS> --event-filter period=18552 --from-block 0

CSV Output
----------

CLI output can be cumbersome when trying to generate insights and correlate different events. Instead, the event
data can be written to a CSV file using either of the following command-line options:

* ``--csv`` - flag to write event information to default CSV files in the current directory with default filenames
* ``--csv-file <FILEPATH>`` - write event information to a specific CSV file at the provided filepath


For example,

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name PolicyManager --event-name PolicyCreated --from-block 0 --csv

    Reading Latest Chaindata...
    Retrieving events from block 0 to latest

    --------- PolicyManager Events ---------

    PolicyManager::PolicyCreated events written to PolicyManager_PolicyCreated_2021-02-24_20-02-32.csv


.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name PolicyManager --event-name PolicyCreated --from-block 0 --csv-file ~/Policy_Events.csv

    Reading Latest Chaindata...
    Retrieving events from block 0 to latest

    --------- PolicyManager Events ---------

    PolicyManager::PolicyCreated events written to /<HOME DIRECTORY>/Policy_Events.csv


To write every PolicyManager smart contract event thus far to corresponding CSV files, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name PolicyManager --from-block 0 --csv

    Reading Latest Chaindata...
    Retrieving events from block 0 to latest

    --------- PolicyManager Events ---------

    PolicyManager::Withdrawn events written to PolicyManager_Withdrawn_2021-02-24_20-47-06.csv


To write StakingEscrow events for a specific Staker for the current period to corresponding CSV files, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher status events --provider <PROVIDER URI> --contract-name StakingEscrow --event-filter staker=<STAKING_ADDRESS> --csv

    No StakingEscrow::Deposited events found

    No StakingEscrow::Withdrawn events found
    No StakingEscrow::WorkMeasurementSet events found
    No StakingEscrow::WorkerBonded events found


.. note::

    If there were no events found, a CSV file is not written to.


.. important::

    When using the ``--csv-file`` option, since different events can have different
    properties, the ``--event-name`` and ``--contract-name`` options must be specified. If querying for multiple
    events at the same time i.e. running the command without ``--event-name``, the ``--csv`` option can be used
    to generate separate default filenames for the different events.
